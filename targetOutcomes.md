For this article you should focus on the findings reported for in "Section 3 Results". Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Results from the first question of the original trick, without providing a false solution, show that 83% (25/30) of the participants found the correct solution (all the cards are the same), and none proposed the physical influence false solution. These results confirm that the correct solution of the trick is far more obvious than the physical influence false solution.

> As shown in Fig. 3a (see also Appendix A), there was a clear effect of the exposure to the false solution in the percentage of participants who discovered the correct solution after the first question. Results of chi-square tests showed that the percentage of participants who found the correct solution in the original trick group (83%) was significantly greater than both the percentage in the FS conditional trick group (17%, χ2 = 26.67, p < 0.001) and the percentage in the FS extinction trick group (13%, χ2 = 29.43, p < 0.001). Furthermore, for the two FS groups, participants who did not find the secret of the trick typically found solutions related to the false solution (e.g., “the card that the magician touched longer”). There is no significant difference between the percentage of participants who found the correct solution in the FS conditional trick group (17%) and the percentage in the FS extinction trick group (13%, χ2 = 0.13, p = 0.72).

> We next examined participants who did not initially solve the problem but then received the conditional or extinction test questions. Their results are shown in Fig. 3b (see also Appendix A). Results showed that the percentage of participants who found the correct solution in the conditional test question (20%) was significantly different from the percentage in the extinction test question (73%, χ2 = 14.41, p < 0.001) (for each condition, all the participants who answered “yes” for the first part of the test question found the correct solution).
